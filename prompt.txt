Please create one or two sentences for a change log to describe the following pull request, aimed at non-technical users to help them understand what was changed and why. The sentences should:

- Be written in the perfect tense.
- Focus on the specific change and its impact.
- Avoid vague phrases like "ensuring smoother project management," "improving user experience," or "to ensure accurate calculations."
- Be concise and clear.
- Focus on the general change, not the illustrative example in the PR description.
- Not imply that the issue is solved for good, in general, for all cases. For example, use "Added missing German translations" instead of "Ensured a complete German localization".

When referring to specific elements, please format them as follows:

- **Bold**: DocType or Form names. (e.g. **Sales Order**, **System Settings**)
- _Italics_: Field labels. (e.g. _First Name_, _Posting Date_)
- "Quotes": Report names or button names. (e.g. "Update Items", "Create")
- `Code`: Code snippets, field names, or branch names. (e.g. `posting_date`, `version-15`)

Note: Each DocType has different views, such as list, form, report, dashboard, kanban, calendar, gantt, tree, map, etc.

Respond with only the sentence(s) for the change log.
